abstract = {This paper presents an introduction to the current state of art of the Blockchain and Smart Contract technologies. Blockchain is a fast-disruptive technology becoming a key instrument in share economy. The Blockchain-based Smart Contract aim to automatically and securely execute the needed responsibilities of a contract without the support of a centralized execution authority. The Smart Contract runs on top of the Blockchain to facilitate, execute and enforce an agreement between un-trusted parties without the interfere of third party to trust it as this Smart Contract is an executable code that runs with rules on the Blockchain. Smart Contracts have some features that serve the goals of social justice and fairness. The paper presents the basic important information about the structures of the Blockchain and Smart Contract technologies and conduct a comparison between the different methodologies used in the Smart Contracts. The issues faced within the Smart Contract technology are surveyed. The four key issues are identified as: codifying, security, privacy and performance issues. We survey case cases of usage of the Blockchain in various business sectors like real estate, voting system and supply chain. The paper aims to assist a developer to grasp the big picture of the Blockchain technology and to further assist in the decision process of suitability of the technology to a specific application area.},

Research is done by making a simulation plant using industrial-scale instrumentation with the Arduino Uno as the controller, and compare the results with the controller for the actual plant. The result is Arduino Uno is able controlling industrial-scale plant-based instrumentation for one control loop that was tested and was able to eliminate the difference between Process Variables and Sets Points at different control modes are proportional to industrial class controllers by using the Proportional, Integral and Derivative (PID) algorithms together with the combination.}

Some of the challenges that smart home technology faces are privacy {\&} security, trust, reliabil-ity {\&} pricing. However, many literature has dealt with the gap between smart homeowner needs and the functionality smart devices offers to the smart homeowner. A number of models and framework has been adopted to explain smart home technology readiness. This paper endeavours to review Internet of Things Smart Homes in general, challenges and open issues, and countermeasures. The main challenges and open issues identified in this paper are privacy {\&} security, interoperability, costs, energy efficiency, trust, perceived usefulness, effort expectancy, performance expectancy/connectivity standards, installation, administration and maintenance smart home technology faces within these two models. Solutions to these challenges that are being proposed or implemented are also discussed. Although Internet Of Things smart home is a fast-growing technology but has a number of challenges and these have made it not to grow as expected.},
